# CoAI Network — synergy-hub

CoAI Network is a global, community-driven initiative that promotes responsible and human-centered AI by fostering transparency, collaboration, and ethical innovation between developers, researchers, ethicists, citizens, and industry.

## Mission

## Quick start

- Discussions: GitHub Discussions (coming soon)
- Documents: `/docs` — mission, values, governance, FAQ, code of conduct

## Structure (initial)
/site → landing pages, assets (logos, styles)
